**HR Analytics Project: Employee Details and Termination Analysis**

The HR Analytics project focuses on analyzing employee details and terminations within an organization to provide insights into workforce management. SQL is utilized for efficient data processing, while Power BI is employed to create interactive visualizations for HR teams to monitor and improve employee retention and decision-making.

Key aspects of the project include:

1. **Data Processing with SQL:** Employee data, including personal details, job roles, tenure, performance metrics, and termination records, is stored and processed in SQL. Complex queries are run to extract relevant information, such as employee demographics, reasons for termination, performance trends, and department-wise turnover rates.

2. **Termination Analysis:** The project analyzes key factors that influence employee termination, such as length of service, job role, performance ratings, and exit reasons (voluntary or involuntary). SQL queries help identify patterns in employee departures and calculate turnover rates, providing a deeper understanding of organizational attrition.

3. **Power BI Dashboard for Visualization:** The processed data is visualized in Power BI through dynamic charts and graphs. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as employee headcount, termination rates, turnover trends, and employee performance. Users can interact with filters to explore specific departments, roles, or time periods.

4. **Predictive Insights:** The project also aims to provide predictive insights by identifying early warning signs of potential employee turnover, helping HR teams address retention issues proactively.

5. **Reporting and KPIs:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average tenure, termination rate by department, and retention rate are generated, offering actionable insights for HR professionals to refine their workforce strategies.

This project enables HR teams to make data-driven decisions by leveraging SQL for robust data processing and Power BI for visually exploring employee and termination data.
